Built upon the work here. -> https://github.com/nvoss/BonusChallenge

Hidden flags that can be claimed by any team.

Reworked the above so that there are no changes to core CTFd and migrated (copied and pasted) to nunjucks.

# Installation

Works with CTFd 1.2.0 

1. Clone this repository to `CTFd/plugins`. It is important that the folder is
named `BonusChallenge` so CTFd can serve the files in the `assets`
directory.
